Kafka Connect Homework

The Kafka Connect Homework demonstrated how to easily connect applications with Kafka and deploy them. This assignment emphasized the importance of deployment in such applications and provided me with more experience using Terraform/Kubernetes for this purpose.
Additionally, customization of Kafka Connect operators is an essential part of working with them, so this homework taught me how to customize them if needed.
By the end of this assignment, I had gained practical skills in connecting applications with Kafka, deploying them, and customizing Kafka Connect operators.

#### Preparations:

First I created a new Resource Group in Azure:

Then I created a storage account:

Here you can see the completed storage account:

Then I created a "tfstae" container for the terraform state logs:
